                          projects. A good percentage of the attendees were able to submit their very first pull request and were super 
                          excited to get into hacktoberfest.
                          Enlightened most of the attendees with the usefulness of linux OS while working with open source technologies.

                <li><h1>HacktoberFest HackNight</h1>
                 <br />
                  <br />13th October
                    <br />
                    <br />This was one of the most successful event our community conducted! 
                          We're planning to host the same for upcoming years too. 
                          There were a lot of ups and downs for hosting this event, but everything went well, 
                          thanks to the early arrival of GitHub sponsorship and Sponsorship from our state gov's
                          initiative to promote technical and entrepreneurship activities in colleges.
                          We had 140 participants + 30 Mentors/volunteers. The no. of the mentors may seem large,
                          since it is a beginner friendly event, we had to work a little harder to mentor the teams 
                          throughout the night because most of them were at their very first hackathon or they were 
                          building something with their academic knowledge for the first time.
