The purpose of the event was to introduce the new team leads to the students and provide an overview of SOSC's goals and future plans. The program was led by the newly appointed President, Deveesh Shetty.

## President's Welcome and Team Introduction:
The program commenced with President welcoming all the participants and expressing gratitude for their presence. He then introduced the new leads of SOSC, highlighting their roles and responsibilities within the organization. This served to familiarize the participants with the individuals who would be leading the various initiatives of SOSC.

## Explanation of SOSC and Future Plans:

The President and other team leads addressed the queries raised, ensuring a clear understanding of the organization's purpose and functioning.

## Riddle Competition:
To engage the participants and add an element of fun to the event, the team organized a riddle competition.
