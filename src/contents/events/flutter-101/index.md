## Flutter 101
Flutter is Google's UI toolkit to build visually stunning applications for mobile, web and desktop applications - *all in a single codebase!* Bringing your app to life has never been faster with it's fully customizable widgets to build native interfaces in a minute. Build expressive and beautiful UI's for your users with rich motion APIs and smooth natural scrolling. And with Flutter, you can avoid keeping multiple codebases for iOS and Android! What's not to love? 🤩
