## Post Event Report
This was the first event we had conducted alongside codechef and was pretty successful. We welcomed about 200 students to the event who were very active during the sessions. We rewarded the students who were active with stickers from Hack-Club. Many were also excited because we had called upon Prakhyath Rai, who used to teach here at Sahyadri College of Engineering and Management. He was loved by most of his students for his love for teaching students programming.
To conclude the event a small competitive programming contest was held with a few goodies and laddus from codechef and Hack Club for the winners.

We did experience a few problems like connectivity issues since it was conducted online and had to reschedule a few of the sessions being conducted during the event due to internals and christmas.

## Attendance
We had about 250 students register for the event, most of them were 1st year students as the event was focused on beginners but we also had a few first and decond years help out the juniors during the event.

## Positives
The students have been very active since they were beginners and interested in the event. 
The students were very happy with the swags they received.
We got good feedback from the students, they wanted more workshops to be conducted for them in the future.

## Negatives
We did experience some technical difficulties due to poor connectivity.
We also had to reschedule some of the sessions due to internals and christmas

## Summary
We were able to provide the students with a really good first experience of a workshop. They responded very well and were excited about more workshops to be conducted in the future. We were able to reach out to many first years and guide them well. Since this was our first workshop in association with codechef and since it went very well we will be conducting many more in the days to come.
