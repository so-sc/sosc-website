## STL for Compitetive Programming
Are you struggling to solve coding problems in given time ? Do you hate having to type out code for data structures and simple algorithms while solving bigger problem ? If so, we have a small trick up our sleeve which will make your Competitive Programming woes more forgiving. Let's learn about C++ STL.

## You Will Be Learning
STL ( Standard Template Library ) is a set of C++ template classes providing common data structures and algorithms. STLs make Competitive Programming easier and faster.
