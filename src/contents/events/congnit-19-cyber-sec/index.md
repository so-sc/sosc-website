## COGNIT - Cyber Security Workshop

### [Register Now](http://bit.ly/CyberSecWorkshop-COGNIT)

Cybersecurity is the convergence of people, processes and technology that come together to protect organizations, individuals or networks from digital attacks.

We will learn how to get you started with understanding cyber security as a domain, 🧠 Basic knowledge required for a strong foundation, 📚 Summary on cyber laws and punishments, 💰Brief on Jobs and earnings through bugs and bounty hunting and  💻 We will dive right into a hands on session.

Like most hands on session we don't want you to learn only during the workshop but after you leave the workshop too so we show you the tools, trades of the craft and in the end provide a road map to truly pursue your interest in cyber security. 
 
The workshop is free of cost and we will be performing exploits on real vulnerable applications and setup a hacking lab on your laptops with documentation to help you learn during and after the workshop.

Pre requisite:
- A laptop fully charged ( Just in case you can't find a plug point)
- Install Virtual Box on your latop ( Minimum 4GB RAM would be great)
