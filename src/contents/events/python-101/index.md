# Python 101

Python 101 is a beginner friendly Python workshop conducted by SOSWC. Since it's a beginner's worskhop, you don't have to have any earlier programming information. The main aim of this workshop is to introduce programming and basics of python to participants/attendees.
Python is a general-purpose language which is designed to be simple to read and write. The point that it’s not a complex language is important. The designers placed less of an emphasis on conventional syntax, which makes it easier to work with, even for non-programmers or developers.
