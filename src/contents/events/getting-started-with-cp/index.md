## Getting Better at Compitetive Programming with CodeChef
Competitive programming is a mental sport in which you must code a given problem while adhering to certain limits.  
It is a software industry niche that has recently sparked a lot of attention.  
We all want to compete and win, but where do we start? The CodeChef SCEM chapter is helping with this by demonstrating how to effectively use CODECHEF, a popular competitive programming platform, to develop programming abilities.  
This platform encourages continuous learning and friendly programming competitions for its users, as well as the assistance of a vast community of problem curators.  
There will also be a quiz  on C++ at the end of the session with prizes given to the victors.
